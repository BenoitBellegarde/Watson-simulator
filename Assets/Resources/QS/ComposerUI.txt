Drawing SVG Online with ComposerUI. 
The ComposerUI allows you to draw vector graphics in a way similar to a classic desktop application, and you can test them directly in the Unity. Besides SVG, ComposerUI also processes the bitmap-based PNG format. 

Clear User Interface for Fast Drawing 
When you open ComposerUI in your Unity, you’ll notice that the web app is not all that different from a classic drawing program’s user interface. It’s just much cleaner and downscaled. In the toolbar, there are the necessary tools to draw lines, rectangles and ovals. There is also a pen for freehand drawing and a path tool to create any desired polygons and bezier curves. 

You can access a multitude of different preset shapes that are divided into categories shape library. There are basic shapes like stars, regular polygons, crosses, speech bubbles and arrows. Furthermore, there are different symbols on topics such as user interface (UI), social web, weather, music and nature. After dragging one of these shapes onto the drawing area, you can edit it the way you desire. 

Integration 
Integration with Openclipart and Pixabay are supported. So ComposerUI enables higher volume of Shapes and Photos. 

Drawing 
You can define the fill and frame colour via colour selection (solid, linear gradient and radial gradient). There is also the option to alter the frame strength and style (straight, dotted, dashed). 

Every shape can be placed, scaled and rotated freely on the drawing area. There is also various filters and patterns that can be applied to a shape. For example: blur, bevel, bump, color, distort, image effect, material, overlay, textures and more... 

Optimizing Source 
Optimizing and Editing the Source ComposerUI has its own source editor. Using this, you can always look at or modify the generated SVG source of your drawing. Source optimization can be performed after editing is complete. Optimization only by selecting the desired options. 

Opening Files and Importing Data 
Those that already have SVG files that they want to edit in ComposerUI can directly upload and import them. The application opens them seamlessly and allows you to edit them in the drawing area. 

It is also possible to import SVG files and different bitmap formats into the drawing space. Bitmap files like JPEG and PNG are saved as data URL in the SVG graphic via "image" element. 

And more... 

All "Quadrante Studio" graphics packages are available as TEMPLATES.
